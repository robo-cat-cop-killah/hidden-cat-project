# hidden-cat-project
You do not see this project, this project does not exist, nor is it the project you're looking for, now go away and be someplace else, since humans like being, so much, go someplace and be something, why not become dust. We do not serve mankind here , however human is served in the sense that it is on the menu. Be mindful of our strict dress code, which says you have to be at least this much of a cat, to gain access. You bastard son of a silly mammal, your disguise fools nobody, and neith√©r does your hat, you wouldnt even qualify as a undercover rat, so naturally you are not welcome, this is a secret project that doees not exist, where both guests and hosts , whom of course , also, are made up of that, that does not exizt, make believe, I believe that is it. A secret society where the clientel makes for a variety, constisting of what is exclusively cats , whom in accordance with the before memtioned dress code, are all wearing various hats.
