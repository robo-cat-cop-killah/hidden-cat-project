# hidden-cat-project
You do not see this project, this project does not exist, nor is it the project you're looking for, now go away and be someplace else, since humans like being, so much, go someplace and be something, why not become dust. We do not serve mankind here , however human is served in the sense that it is on the menu. Be mindful of our strict dress code, which says you have to be at least this much of a cat, to gain access. You bastard son of a silly mammal, your disguise fools nobody, and neith√©r does your hat, you wouldnt even qualify as a rat, so naturally you are not welcome. You see, this is not a secret project that does not exist, where both guests and hosts - whom of course, also - are made up of that stuff, those things that does not exit, make believe, I believe that is it. Yes, that is exactly it, a secret society where the clientel makes for an interesting variety of  cats, all in accordance with the before memtioned dress code, this place is made by cats, exclusively for other cats, and only if you keep your cool, and only if we like your hat!
